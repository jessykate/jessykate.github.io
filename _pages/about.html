<h2>About Jessy Kate </h2>

<article class="card">
I am a researcher in <strong>outer space policy</strong> and governance at the Open
Lunar Foundation, with a particular focus on policy and coordination questions
for near term lunar activity. The space domain is what is called an Area Beyond
national Jurisdiction (ABNJ), and involves wrestling with many questions
similar to those raised by commons management from the high seas to the
Internet. 
</p>
<p>
I have worked with <strong>self-governing collectives, autonomous networks and place
based intentional communities</strong> for almost two decades. These projects have led
her to a broader interest in the foundational ingredients of international law,
and new approaches to sovereignty, jurisdiction and institution design.
