<h2>Spaces</h2>

<p>
Over the years I've been involved in starting and stewarding a number of
place-based communities and self-governance projects. 
</p>

<p>
What I love about these
projects is the ways in which physical spaces require us engage with questions
of finite resource management and navigate the interface with existing rulesets (from zoning and permitting
to loans), motivating real tradeoffs in decision making that force interrogation of our values. 
</p>

<p>
Thomas Franck <sub><small>(Fairness in International Law and Institutions, 1998)</small></sub> says that the conditions for
fairness are most likely to be found when we have the following conditions: a
sense of community, and <i>moderate</i> scarcity. Here we create community
through the ongoing process of co-creation as peers, and (when we do it well!)
we moderate the amount of scarcity through initial conditions, financial
models, and participation architectures. By creating “communities of fate,” <sub><small>(Eugene Holland, Nomad Citizenship)</small></sub> we
motivate critical inquiry, mutual support, active experimentation and the
sharing of resources.

</p>

<p>
The physicality of place-based projects also creates a visceral, embodied
experience of changing the rules: when we say "the rules are different here"
that immediately translates into a lived experience.

  <h3>The Embassy Network</h3>
  <h5><a href="http://embassynetwork.com">http://embassynetwork.com/</a></h5>
  <p>
  The Embassy Network has been an informal collection of intentional
  communities since 2012, using space as a platform to experiment with new ways
  of organizing, making decisions and allocating resources.
  </p>

  <p>
  A group of scientists and young space professionals realized that the
  domestic sphere has certain important qualities in common with research
  outposts and eventual settlements on other planets: small groups of people
  making decisions together over a shared domain. Far from being a blank slate,
  the seeds of future civilizations will be formed by the social norms and
  coordination mechanisms we develop today. If we truly want space to be a new
  chapter in human history, we need to get better at organizing ourselves on
  the original human settlement: Earth.
